# SmartLeave – Leave Management System

## 📌 Overview

**SmartLeave** is a real-world assignment project designed to evaluate your full understanding of building enterprise-level web applications using **ASP.NET Core** with **layered architecture**. You will develop:

- A **Web API** (ASP.NET Core API)
- A **Razor MVC web app** (ASP.NET Core MVC)

The MVC application must **only communicate with the API** using `HttpClient`. There should be **no direct DB access** in the MVC project.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

You are expected to demonstrate:

- Layered architecture separation
- Authentication & authorization
- Business workflows beyond CRUD
- API-first design and documentation
- Frontend-backend communication via HTTP
- Clean code and developer discipline

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SmartLeave.sln

│

├── SmartLeave.API → ASP.NET Core Web API (no Razor)

├── SmartLeave.MVC → Razor frontend (no direct DB access)

├── SmartLeave.BLL → Business logic (interfaces + services)

├── SmartLeave.DAL → EF Core entities, DbContext, repositories

└── SmartLeave.Common → Shared validators, helpers, constants
